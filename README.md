# FOR THE OFFSHORE TEAM, READ THIS BEFORE YOU START DEVELOPPING

# INSTALLS:

Do not forget to run:

    npm install
    
Before you begin, just so the project runs on npm.
There are other outside frame works that we used as well.
If your project does not work, run the following installs.

     npm install --save react-router-dom
     npm install --save redux
     npm install --save react-redux
     npm install --save bootstrap
     npm install --save axios
